# Secure & Share Government Documents with Family Members

## 📝 Project Description

This project offers a secure and user-friendly platform for Indian citizens to store, manage, and share essential government-issued documents (like PAN cards, mark sheets, passports) in digital format. It significantly reduces the risk of document loss by linking each account with the user's Aadhaar number and facilitates seamless online sharing, promoting the transition towards a paperless society.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Digitize and securely store government documents.
* Enable verified document sharing among family members.
* Ensure Aadhaar-based authentication and document linkage.
* Reduce physical dependency and related government overheads.
* Provide universal access across key sectors (education, healthcare, transport, etc.).
